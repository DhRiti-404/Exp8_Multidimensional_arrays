# Exp8_Multidimensional_arrays
 This experiment focuses on implementing basic matrix operations with a strong emphasis on input validation. The program begins by accepting the number of rows and columns for two matrices from the user. It then checks whether both matrices have the same dimensionsâ€”a necessary condition for matrix addition.
